\section{Problem Statement}
Two groups are competing for the position on the board of directors of a corporation.The probabilities that the first and the second groups will win are 0.6 and 0.4 respectively.Further,if the first group wins,the probability of introducing a new product is 0.7 and the corresponding probability is 0.3 if the second group wins.Find the probability that the new product introduced was by the second group.
\section{Solution}
Let $H \in \{0,1\}$ be the random variable denoting which the group A wins, with $H=0$ representing group A wins. Let $H \in \{0,1\}$ be the random variable denoting whether the product being introduced, with $M=0$ representing that the product is not introduced by A. 

We are given that:
\begin{align*}
Pr(H=0)&=0.6\\
Pr(M=1|H=0)&=0.42\\
Pr(M=1|H=1)&=0.12\\
\end{align*}
Therefore, by Bayes Theorem, we say that:
\begin{align*}
Pr(H=1\vert M=1)&=\frac{Pr(M=1\vert H=1)\cdot Pr(H=1)}{\sum_{i=0}^{1} Pr(M=1\vert H=i)\cdot Pr(H=i)}\\
&=\frac{\pr(M=1 \vert H=1)\cdot Pr(H=1)}{\splitfrac{Pr(M=1\vert H=1)\cdot Pr(H=1)}{+Pr(M=1\vert H=0)\cdot Pr(H=0)}}\\
&=\dfrac{0.3\cdot 0.4}{0.3\cdot 0.4 + 0.6\cdot 0.7}\\
&=\dfrac{12}{54}\\
&=0.23
\end{align*}
The probability that the new product introduced by the second group B is 0.23.
